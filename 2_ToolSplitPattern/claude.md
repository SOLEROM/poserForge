Service + Tool Split Pattern (Daemon + One-Shot Tools)

This pattern models systems where a long-running background service exists alongside disposable command-style tools that operate against it. Compose defines a persistent service container that owns state, networking endpoints, and long-term runtime behavior, while separate short-lived tool containers share the same image and configuration but execute isolated commands and exit immediately. Shared volumes are used so both service and tools operate on the same workspace or session data. The design demonstrates separation of responsibilities between orchestration-level services and operational utilities while maintaining environment consistency. The usage model teaches how to start the service once, execute tools repeatedly without polluting the host system, inspect logs independently, and maintain a clean lifecycle for automation and scripting workflows.

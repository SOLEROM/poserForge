Multi-Service Pipeline Pattern (Composable Processing Stack)

This pattern demonstrates Compose as an orchestration layer for a pipeline of cooperating services, where each container represents a single logical stage of processing. Services communicate over the internal Compose network using service names rather than fixed addresses. Data flow occurs through shared volumes or network APIs depending on the latency and persistence requirements. The design emphasizes loose coupling, allowing individual pipeline components to be restarted or replaced independently. The primary teaching goal is to show how Compose can represent an entire system architecture — not just isolated containers — enabling developers to bring up a full local stack for integration testing or experimentation with a single command.

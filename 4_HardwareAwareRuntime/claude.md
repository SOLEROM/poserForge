Hardware-Aware Runtime Pattern (Edge / Embedded Deployment)

This pattern defines a Compose setup intended to run on hardware-constrained or accelerator-enabled systems such as GPUs, NPUs, cameras, or USB-attached devices. Containers are configured to access host devices or privileged runtime capabilities while still maintaining container isolation for application logic. The compose design separates hardware access configuration from application behavior, allowing the same image to run in simulated environments or real hardware targets by changing runtime profiles. The pattern demonstrates how Compose can standardize deployment across development hosts and embedded targets while controlling device visibility, restart behavior, and persistent runtime data. The usage model focuses on predictable startup on boot, automatic recovery, and minimal manual intervention.

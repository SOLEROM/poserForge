This pattern defines a Docker Compose project whose purpose is to provide a fully reproducible development environment independent of the host operating system. The compose file describes a single long-lived development container that contains toolchains, SDKs, and runtime dependencies required for a project. Source code and configuration are mounted from the host as bind mounts, while caches and generated artifacts are stored in named volumes to avoid polluting the host filesystem. The container is started interactively and behaves like a persistent shell environment rather than a service. The design demonstrates how Compose can replace manual environment setup, ensuring every developer or CI runner uses the same runtime environment, dependency versions, and filesystem layout. The usage model emphasizes entering the container, performing development tasks, and shutting down without losing environment state.
